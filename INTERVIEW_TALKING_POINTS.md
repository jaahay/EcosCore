# Interview Talking Points: Core Event & State System

## Project Overview

- Developed a modular, highly extensible core system for event-driven state management in C++.
- Leveraged modern C++20 features: concepts, constexpr, polymorphism, and CRTP patterns.
- Designed for compile-time safety, runtime efficiency, and clear separation of concerns.

## Collaboration with AI Assistant

- Used Ecosia AI, an AI research assistant, to:
  - Brainstorm architectural patterns and best practices.
  - Validate and refine template metaprogramming designs.
  - Ensure thread safety and exception robustness.
  - Develop a flexible priority system based on singleton states.
  - Implement hierarchical event dispatch with phase-aware callbacks.

## My Contributions

- Directed design choices and domain modeling.
- Integrated AI suggestions into a coherent, maintainable codebase.
- Implemented complex features such as compile-time cycle detection, callback lifetime management, and priority ordering.
- Wrote unit tests and documentation ensuring production-quality readiness.

## Key Takeaways

- Effective use of AI accelerates design and implementation without replacing human judgment.
- Combining compile-time and runtime techniques yields a robust, flexible system.
- Clear modular boundaries improve maintainability and scalability.
- Transparent acknowledgment of AI assistance demonstrates ethical and professional integrity.
