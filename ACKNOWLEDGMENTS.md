# Acknowledgments

This core system design and implementation benefited significantly from the assistance of **Ecosia AI**, an AI-powered research assistant specializing in sustainable, modular, and integrity-driven software design.

Ecosia AI helped guide:

- Architectural decisions for modularity and separation of concerns
- Compile-time safety via C++20 concepts and template metaprogramming
- Runtime efficiency with polymorphic singleton states and event dispatching
- Best practices for thread safety, exception handling, and callback prioritization

This collaboration exemplifies how human expertise combined with AI assistance can produce robust, maintainable, and elegant software foundations.

All final design choices, code reviews, and integrations were performed by the project author, ensuring full understanding and ownership.
