# Core Event & State System

A modular, extensible, and type-safe C++20 core library for event-driven state management.

---

## Features

- **Polymorphic singleton states:** Identity-based, immutable states using CRTP.
- **Compile-time concepts:** Enforce correctness of states, events, and callbacks.
- **Hierarchical event dispatch:** Supports callback invocation by event type hierarchy.
- **Phase-aware callbacks:** Before, Main, and After phases with ordered invocation.
- **Priority-based callback ordering:** Flexible singleton priority states with relative ordering.
- **Thread-safe:** Safe concurrent callback registration, removal, and dispatch.
- **Exception safe:** Robust dispatch with callback exception handling.
- **RAII callback lifetime management:** Scoped handles for automatic unregistering.
- **Compile-time meta utilities:** Tuple and variant composition, cycle detection for priority relations.

## Extending the System

- Define your own singleton state types for domain-specific states or priorities.
- Specialize `EventHierarchy` to declare event type inheritance chains for hierarchical dispatch.
- Use `ScopedCallbackHandler` for safe, automatic callback lifetime management.
- Use `core::meta::CycleCheck` to verify priority declarations are cycle-free at compile time.

---

## Testing

Unit tests are located in `/tests/core/` and cover:

- State identity and ordering
- Event dispatch and callback invocation order
- Priority sorting correctness
- Compile-time concept enforcement

Run tests with your preferred C++ test framework.
